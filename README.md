# Klippventurer-mods
This is my contribution to the Klippventurer project.

In my Adventurer 3 printer upgrade process, the next step after upgrading the operating system to Klipper (Klippventurer) is to replace the extruder.
I had an old Voron Clockwork extruder lying around.  So I decided to go from there.
The result is an extruder whose internal parts are those of the Clockwork but whose fasteners are modified.
Printing:
The printing parameters are those prescribed by Voron: ABS, layer height 0.2mm, extrusion width 0.4,
filling 40%, grid type filling..., walls 4, upper/ lower layers 5 and no support.
For the legs I suggest a skirt.  Cut the parts in triangle.  These are supports.
Hardware and assembly:
The hardware and assembly is essentially the same as Voronâ€™s:

The main differences are the attachment of the legs and an ECAS coupler.
